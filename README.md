In addition to solve the challenge proposed by Frontend Mentor, my goal was to apply some professionnal methods: feature-based architecture, continuous integration and deployment, testing, pull requests.

As I wanted to play with API, I chose to make multiple API calls when it would have been more efficient to make just one call to fetch all countries then work on this data set.

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/), bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- Responsive, mobile-first workflow
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- CSS custom properties
- [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules)
- [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) for testing

### What I learned

As expected, I practiced with REST API and asynchronous code.

This time again I also learned a lot in CSS.

On HTML side, it was my first time building a custom select menu and I tried to fulfill accessibility requirements.

### Continued development

I plan to continue my learning of [React](https://reactjs.org/) by building projects with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) framework.

### Useful resources

- [React-router URLs don't work when refreshing or writing manually](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27928372/react-router-urls-dont-work-when-refreshing-or-writing-manually) - This thread helped me to understand my options for routing in single page applications.
